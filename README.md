Make this code shine!

- Write DRY code

    - DRY as in DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF
    - If you need some functionality that has been implemented before,
      find a way to reuse it, avoid WET code (as in WE ENJOY TYPING :D)

- Write KISS code

    - KISS as in KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID
    - Designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible

- Write YAGNI code

    - YAGNI as in YOU AREN'T GONNA NEED IT
    - Features should only be added when required

- Be careful with libs and external code

    - Yes they're cool and save us lot's of time
    - But they also introduce bugs bugs bugs... oh we hate them
    - Always make sure you know what lib/chunk of code does, and how to use it properly

- Keep clear

    - Remove unused stuff the moment it becomes unused
    - It is really hard to track down all unused stuff later
    - Don't hesitate to remove something you found useless
      (It's source controlled, we can always bring it back)

- Keep layouts simple

    - Don't use unnecessary nesting
    - More Nested layouts - more lags
